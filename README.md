## 🚖 Premise

You are a raccoon. A criminal mastermind of the picnic park.  
Your mission: steal as many snacks as possible without being spotted by the humans.

> Think *Untitled Goose Game* meets *Metal Gear Solid*—but fuzzier, dumber, and more delicious.

## 🍿 Core Gameplay Features

- **VR Hand Interaction:** Grab, toss, and hoard snack items using intuitive motion controls.
- **Snack Objects:** Fully physics-based foods.
- **AI Patrols:** Clueless humans roam the park—spotting you triggers pursuit (and snack loss).
- **Stealth Mechanics:** Duck behind picnic tables to stay out of sight.
- **Score System:** Rack up snack points. But be warned—getting caught is a point killer.
